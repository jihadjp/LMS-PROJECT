9. Risk Management
Risk
	Probability
	Impact
	Mitigation Strategy
	Payment gateway integration delays
	Medium
	High
	Start integration early (Week 2), have developer docs ready.
	Video upload/streaming issues
	Medium
	High
	Test cloud storage integration in Week 1; use simple direct streaming.
	Scope creep
	High
	Critical
	Strict "no new features" policy; defer all non-MVP requests.
	Testing time insufficient
	High
	High
	Test continuously during development, not just at the end.
	Team availability issues
	Medium
	Critical
	Ensure team 100% dedicated; have backup developers identified.
	Third-party service downtime
	Low
	Medium
	Have a fallback plan (e.g., manual processing temporarily).
	10. Constraints & Trade-offs
To achieve 1-month delivery, we accept:
1. Simplified features: Only core MVP functionality
2. Manual processes: Some admin tasks manual initially (instructor approval, payouts)
3. Basic UI: Template-based design, not custom
4. Limited testing: Manual testing only, no automated tests in MVP
5. Single payment gateway: Only one option initially
6. No advanced analytics: Basic counts only
7. Minimal notifications: Only critical emails
8. Direct video streaming: No transcoding or adaptive quality
9. Simple certificate: Basic template, no customization
10. Documentation debt: Minimal documentation, improved post-launch
These trade-offs are acceptable for speed-to-market and will be addressed in subsequent iterations.
